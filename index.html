    David Khari Webber Chappelle (/ʃəˈpɛl/; born August 24, 1973) is an American stand-up comedian, 
    actor, writer and producer. He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including four Emmy Awards and 
    three Grammy Awards as well as the Mark Twain Prize. He is known for his satirical comedy sketch series
 Chappelle's Show (2003–2006). The series, co-written with Neal Brennan, ran until Chappelle quit the show
 in the middle of production of the third season. After leaving the show, Chappelle returned to performing
     stand-up comedy across the U.S. By 2006, Chappelle was called the "comic genius of America" by Esquire
     and, in 2013, "the best" by a Billboard writer. In 2017, Rolling Stone ranked him No. 9 in their "50 Best 
       Stand Up Comics of All Time".

Chappelle has appeared in several films, including Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993), The Nutty Professor
 (1996), Con Air (1997), You've Got Mail (1998), Blue Streak (1999), Undercover Brother (2002), Chi-Raq 
 (2015), and A Star Is Born (2018). His first lead role was in the 1998 comedy film Half Baked, which he 
 co-wrote with Neal Brennan. Chappelle also starred in the ABC comedy series Buddies (1996). In 2016, 
 he signed a $20 million-per-release comedy-special deal with Netflix and, as of 2019, he has released 
 five standup specials under the deal.

Chappelle received his first Emmy Award in 2017 for his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live.
 In 2018, he received a Grammy Award for his Netflix-produced comedy album The Age of Spin & 
Deep in the Heart of Texas. Equanimity, another Netflix special featuring Chappelle, was nominated 
in 2018 for three Emmys and received the award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded). In 2019,
 Chappelle was selected to receive the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which is presented by the
  Kennedy Center as America's highest comedy honor. In 2020, Sticks & Stones earned Chappelle his
   third consecutive Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.
